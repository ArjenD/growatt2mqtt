This folder contains the node-red flow, and the Grafana templates I used in my solar integration. Details of this integration can be found in this video:

Above you find the Node-Red flow that I used for my 3 inverters. Of course it is pretty much the same logic 3 files. But just delete the parts that are not required.

The other file is the full export of the Grafana dashboard. It contrains more than what was on my last video, because I was also working on some electricity balance calculation. More about them in these videos:
